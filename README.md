# Maze Project

## Overview

The Maze Project is a Java-based application that implements a maze solver using the Dijkstra algorithm. The project explores object-oriented programming principles in Java and includes a graphical interface for an interactive maze-solving experience.

## Features

- Maze generation
- Dijkstra algorithm for solving mazes
- Graphical user interface (GUI) for maze interaction

## Technologies Used

- Java
- Swing (for GUI)
